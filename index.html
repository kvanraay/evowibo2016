<p>EVO-WIBO is a gathering of evolutionary biologists of the Pacific Northwest. This meeting is held every second year and typically attracts 120-140 researchers for a fun weekend of presentations and discussions. The 2016 Meeting will be held April 15th-17th, 2016.</p>

<p> As it has from its inception, the conference will be held at <a href="http://fortworden.org/" Fort Worden State Park</a> in beautiful Port Townsend, WA. This Washington state park is right on Puget Sound on the Olympic Peninsula, with a small marine science center, a nice beach, and many recreation opportunities nearby. </p>
