<p>EVO-WIBO is a gathering of evolutionary biologists of the Pacific Northwest. This meeting is held every second year and typically attracts 120-140 researchers for a fun weekend of presentations and discussions. The 2016 Meeting will be held April 15th-17th, 2016.</p>

<p> As it has from its inception, the conference will be held at <a href="http://fortworden.org/"> Fort Worden State Park</a> in beautiful Port Townsend, WA. This Washington state park is right on Puget Sound on the Olympic Peninsula, with a small marine science center, a nice beach, and many recreation opportunities nearby. </p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p><a href="http://kvanraay.github.io/evowibo2016/registration">Registration</a> will open in early 2016.</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>A welcome reception will take place Friday evening April 15th. The meeting will run from Saturday morning the 16th through midday Sunday the 17th.</p>
<p>Talks will be 15 minutes in length, including the question period. There will be only a single session at a time, in the Commons at Fort Worden. </p>
<p>We'll have two poster sessions on Saturday, each over an hour long, that overlap with the coffee breaks. The coffee will be set up in the same room as the posters, to draw everyone in. By preference, posters will be set up Friday night upon arrival.</p>
