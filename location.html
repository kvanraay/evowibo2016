<h3>Location</h3>
<p>We have reserved several wings of dormitories in <a href="http://fortworden.org/">Fort Warden</a>; these rooms consist of either one or two single beds with shared bathrooms in each wing. Meals will be held in the dining hall facility very near our meeting rooms. Registration for the meeting includes two nights of accommodation, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration also includes all meals on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday morning, as well as snacks at several coffee breaks and refreshments at evening social events. Fort Worden dormitories provide bedding (pillow, sheet, blanket, pillow case), bath towels, soap, cup, and personal shower mat.</p>
<p>We are striving to make this meeting accessible to all evolutionary biologists in the Pacific Northwest. We are working to provide childcare as well as facilities for nursing moms. 
Wheelchair accessible housing is available. Please contact a member of the <a href="http://evowibo.org/organization">organizing committee</a> directly so that we can accommodate your needs.</p>
<p>Directions from Fort Worden's <a href="http://fortworden.org/get-here/">website:</a></p>

<p>Fort Worden is located in Port Townsend, Washington, on the tip of the Olympic Peninsula. It’s an easy two-and-a-half-hour trip from Seattle and three hours from Vancouver, B.C., but make sure to take in the sights along the way. 
If you’re coming from the North, check out La Conner or Whidbey Island, or even take a side trip to Mt. Baker National Forest. 
Coming from the south, hop a ferry to Bainbridge Island, and experience the scenic route through coastal towns such as Poulsbo and Port Gamble.
