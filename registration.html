        <h1>Registration</h1>
        <p>We have reserved several wings of dormitories in Fort Warden; these rooms consist of either one or two single beds with shared bathrooms in each wing. Meals will be held in the dining hall facility very near our meeting rooms. Registration for the meeting includes two nights of accommodation, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration also includes all meals on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday morning, as well as snacks at several coffee breaks and refreshments at evening social events. Fort Worden dormitories provide bedding (pillow, sheet, blanket, pillow case), bath towels, soap, cup, and personal shower mat. </p>
