<p>We have reserved several wings of dormitories in Fort Warden; these rooms consist of either one or two single beds with shared bathrooms in each wing. Meals will be held in the dining hall facility very near our meeting rooms. Registration for the meeting includes two nights of accommodation, allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration also includes all meals on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday morning, as well as snacks at several coffee breaks and refreshments at evening social events. Fort Worden dormitories provide bedding (pillow, sheet, blanket, pillow case), bath towels, soap, cup, and personal shower mat.</p>
<p>We are striving to make this meeting accessible to all evolutionary biologists in the Pacific Northwest. We are working to provide childcare as well as facilities for nursing moms. 
ADA complient housing is available. Please contact a member of the <a href="http://kvanraay.github.io/evowibo2016/organization">organization committee</a> directly so that we can accommodate your needs.</p>
<p>Online registration will be available in early 2016.</p>
